# FLUX ASSEMBLY

## Relativity
> Flux assembly not to be confused with flux lang is a language that converts directly to x86 assembly.
## Why Flux Assembly?
> Flux Assembly is built with ease of use in mind. Its syntax is inspired by Lua, making it an excellent choice for beginners who want to dive into assembly without the steep learning curve. The language is self-contained and easily modifiable, allowing for a personalized and flexible development experience.
> Moreover, Flux Assembly maintains full backwards compatibility with Lua. This ensures that existing Lua code can be adapted seamlessly into Flux Assembly, providing a straightforward pathway for transitioning from higher-level scripting to more efficient, low-level assembly programming.
## Attribution
> The grammar and syntax of Flux Assembly are heavily inspired by Lua, a language renowned for its simplicity and ease of learning. Lua, developed by the Lua authors (https://www.lua.org/), has been a popular choice for developers looking for an accessible programming language.
> Flux Assembly is a derivative work of Lua's syntax, not intended to replace Lua but to offer an assembly-level option that retains the same beginner-friendly appeal. While this language shares the essence of Lua, it is not an official Lua implementation but a creative evolution designed to bridge the gap between high-level scripting and low-level assembly programming.
> By building on Lua's foundation, Flux Assembly ensures that developers can experience the power and flexibility of assembly without sacrificing the simplicity of their original coding language.
